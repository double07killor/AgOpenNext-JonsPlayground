# AgOpenGPS Hardware Platform Reference

This reference captures representative hardware stacks that operators deploy today when running AgOpenGPS. It is scoped to end-user compute platforms and assumes guidance controllers, implement control ECUs, and GNSS receivers follow the PGN baselines captured elsewhere in the SRS. Each section summarizes total system costs (device, power, mounting, and required accessories), standardization considerations, ease of setup, performance headroom, ruggedness, and mounting implications. Values are indicative ranges in USD as of 2024 and may vary regionally.

### Windows considerations

* **Why it leads today** – AgOpenGPS is primarily developed/tested on Windows, most third-party GNSS drivers and USB tools ship Windows binaries, and farms often have Windows support expertise.
* **Standard images** – Many operators freeze on Windows 10/11 Pro with offline user accounts and minimal services to ensure deterministic startup.
* **Peripheral ecosystems** – Wide availability of CAN-to-USB, RS-232, and Ethernet adapters with signed drivers simplifies multi-module deployments.

## Linux SBCs and industrial PCs

| Platform | Typical configuration | Cost (new) | Cost (used/refurb) | Standardization & lifecycle | Setup & usability | Performance headroom | Ruggedness & environmental tolerance | Mounting & I/O notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Raspberry Pi 5 + AgOpenGPS HAT (concept) | Pi 5 (8 GB), passive case with DIN rail mount, 10.1" HDMI touchscreen, PoE HAT or GPIO machine-control HAT, 12 V to 5 V regulator | $350–$450 (Pi + screen + HAT + power) | $250–$320 (Pi used is rare) | Community-controlled stack; long-term availability via CM4 variants; single SD/EMMC image | Flash Linux distro image (Ubuntu Core/Raspberry Pi OS), install AgOpenGPS build, configure systemd services | Enough for Qt UI + machine control; CPU margin for CAN and RTK streaming | Requires sealed enclosure; wide temp requires heat spreaders; fanless but limited ingress protection | Touchscreen mounts on RAM plate; Pi/HAT stack fits DIN-rail near cab harness; GPIO enables direct section/machine HATs |
| Raspberry Pi CM4 + Waveshare Industrial carrier | CM4 (4–8 GB), carrier with isolated CAN/RS-485, eMMC, 7"-10" touchscreen, IP65 enclosure | $500–$650 | $350–$450 | Better BOM control; carriers sold 5+ years; Yocto/Linux images version-controlled | Prebuilt images reduce setup; AgOpenGPS can run via Qt/Mono builds; remote SSH | Moderate; hardware acceleration limited but adequate for guidance UI | Carrier-rated -20 ° to 70 °C; sealed enclosure reduces dust ingress | Panel-mount display screws into dash; I/O terminals exposed inside enclosure |

| OnLogic/Advantech fanless industrial PCs | Fanless Intel i5/i7 IPC, 8–16 GB RAM, 256 GB SSD, wide 9–36 V input, CAN/serial IO, 12" sunlight-readable panel PC | $1,800–$2,600 | $1,000–$1,600 | 7–10 year lifecycle, configurable SKUs; OEM support for Ubuntu/Debian | Pre-imaged Linux; AgOpenGPS via Mono/Qt; remote fleet management via Ansible | High headroom; supports multi-display, VM, RTK processing | Fanless, sealed IP65/IP66 front, wide temp -20 ° to 60 °C | Panel PCs mount flush to dash; VESA mounting for box PCs; integrated serial/CAN reduces adapters |

### Linux considerations

* **AIO HAT potential** – Pi GPIO exposes SPI/I²C/UART needed for steer/machine hats, enabling single-board “all-in-one” controllers without USB hubs.
* **Real-time control** – Pairing Linux SBCs with co-processors (Arduino, RP2040) or PREEMPT_RT kernels enables deterministic machine control loops.
* **Field maintainability** – SD/EMMC images can be replicated; spare boards are inexpensive to keep on hand.

## Android rugged tablets and handhelds

| Platform | Typical configuration | Cost (new) | Cost (used/refurb) | Standardization & lifecycle | Setup & usability | Performance headroom | Ruggedness & environmental tolerance | Mounting & I/O notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Samsung Galaxy Tab Active4 Pro | 10.1" rugged tablet, Snapdragon 778G, 6 GB RAM, 128 GB, pogo-pin vehicle dock with 12 V adapter | $900–$1,200 | $500–$750 | 3–4 year availability; Knox Manage aids fleet standardization | Install AgOpenGPS Android build/remote client; limited access to native USB drivers | Sufficient for remote UI, mapping, telemetry dashboards; limited for full desktop features | MIL-STD-810H/IP68, replaceable battery, glove/touch modes | Docks bolt to RAM bases; pogo pins provide power + USB passthrough |

| Getac ZX10 | 10" rugged Android tablet, Snapdragon 660, 8 GB RAM, optional keyboard dock, 12 V charger | $1,400–$1,900 | $800–$1,100 | Enterprise supply chain; supports Android Enterprise configurations | Requires sideloading; integrate with AgIO via Wi-Fi/UDP; vendor peripherals available | Enough for remote UIs, CAN dashboards; not ideal for native Windows binaries | Fully rugged (IP66, MIL-STD-810H), glove touch, sunlight readable | Vehicle docks with HDMI-out and dual USB allow external sensors |

### Android considerations

* **Role today** – Android devices are typically remote clients mirroring AgOpenGPS via VNC/WebRTC or running lightweight dashboard apps; full native port would require additional platform investment.
* **Cost vs. capability** – Hardware is cheaper than rugged Windows tablets but lacks drivers for USB-based steer controllers, so they complement rather than replace PC-class hosts.
* **Mounting** – Abundant RAM-compatible cradles; lighter weight reduces bracket stress on smaller cabs.

## Cross-platform observations

* **Power integration** – Regardless of OS, bundle DC-DC converters with surge suppression and ignition sensing to support graceful shutdowns.
* **Input devices** – Cab-friendly accessories (USB knobs, foot switches) should be evaluated per OS driver support.
* **Environmental sealing** – Tablets provide higher ingress protection out of the box; SBC + display builds need custom enclosures and conformal-coated PCBs for long-term reliability.
* **Spare strategy** – Maintain at least one imaged spare tablet/SBC per fleet to minimize planting season downtime.
* **Upgradeable components** – Windows mini PCs and Linux IPCs allow SSD and RAM upgrades; tablets trade repairability for compactness.
