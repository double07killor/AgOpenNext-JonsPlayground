> **Template Coverage:** This single template replaces the standalone section, option, and
> decision-matrix stubs. Use §[X.5] for normative requirements, §[X.10]–§[X.12] for option and
> comparison material, and link supporting ADRs from §[X.16].

## [X.1 Purpose & Scope]

State what this section defines and its purpose within the broader system.  
Explain **what capability** or subsystem it governs, **why it matters**, and **what outcomes** it enables.

> **Example:**  
> This section defines requirements and design options for the [Subsystem or Feature Name].  
> It covers runtime behaviors, integration boundaries, and quality expectations for this capability.

---

## [X.2 Context]

Summarize dependencies, assumptions, and boundaries that influence this capability.

> **Example:**  
> - Depends on [framework, runtime, or component].  
> - Interacts with [other subsystem(s)].  
> - Out of scope: [explicitly state exclusions].

---

## [X.3 Legacy Comparison]

Describe how legacy or prior implementations handled this capability.  
Include limitations and modernization opportunities that motivate this new design.

| Area / Theme | Legacy Behavior | Identified Limitation | Modernization Opportunity | Reference / Source |
|---------------|-----------------|------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------|
| Architecture | Describe historical component structure. | Note coupling or scalability issues. | Describe improved modular or service-oriented approach. | [Link / Issue / Doc] |
| Performance | Describe observed throughput or resource usage. | Identify bottlenecks. | Define optimization or measurement goals. | [Benchmark / Log] |
| UX / Config | Explain how users previously interacted with this function. | Mention pain points or rigidity. | Define proposed UX or configuration improvements. | [Screenshot / Note] |

> **Informative:** Provides background only; does not impose requirements.

---

> **Requirement Grammar (RFC-2119):**  
> - **MUST / MUST NOT** = mandatory; test must exist.  
> - **SHOULD / SHOULD NOT** = strong recommendation; justify exceptions.  
> - **MAY** = optional; document enabling conditions.  
>
> **Clarity Checklist:** Avoid weak words: *fast, robust, user-friendly, handle, support, adequate,* etc.  
> Prefer measurable forms: *“≤ 250 ms p95,” “error rate < 0.1%,” “99.5% success over 10k trials.”*  
> Each requirement: single behavior, single actor, single condition, single metric.

---

## [X.12 Decision Matrix]

This subsection documents the quantitative evaluation used to select among candidate options.

### [X.12.1] Weighting Method

**Purpose:** Explain why each criterion matters and how its relative weight was derived.  
Weights should total **1.0**.

| Criterion | Rationale for Inclusion | Weight |
|------------|------------------------|--------|
| Implementation Complexity | Effort and cost of development and integration. | 0.25 |
| Performance / Quality Impact | Effect on reliability, throughput, accuracy. | 0.25 |
| Maintainability | Long-term sustainability, update cost, readability. | 0.20 |
| Extensibility / Roadmap Fit | Alignment with future features and plugin growth. | 0.20 |
| Ecosystem Alignment | Community familiarity, library maturity, support. | 0.10 |
| **Total** |  | **1.0** |

### [X.12.2] Scoring Scale

Scores use a **1–5 ordinal scale** with descriptive anchors to ensure consistent interpretation.

| Score | Meaning | Qualitative Description |
|-------|----------|-------------------------|
| **1** | Very Poor | Fundamentally unsuited; major blockers. |
| **2** | Poor | Feasible but with unacceptable trade-offs. |
| **3** | Adequate | Meets minimal expectations with caveats. |
| **4** | Good | Performs well and aligns with design goals. |
| **5** | Excellent | Ideal fit; strong performance and maintainability. |

> *Optional:* Use half-steps (e.g., 3.5) when granularity helps, but round totals to two decimals.  
> **Evidence:** Each score must cite a benchmark, prototype, or prior art.

### [X.12.3] Scoring Evidence

Provide a brief justification or data source for each option’s score.

| Criterion | [X]-O1 Justification | [X]-O2 Justification | [X]-O3 Justification |
|------------|---------------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| Implementation Complexity | Prototype required 2 new modules. | Reuses existing interface. | Needs major refactor. |
| Performance / Quality Impact | No known perf gains. | Verified +15% throughput. | Experimental, untested. |
| Maintainability | Adds 3 KLOC. | Simple config-based toggle. | Heavy codegen dependency. |
| Extensibility / Roadmap Fit | Difficult to extend. | Aligns with plugin model. | Tied to legacy API. |
| Ecosystem Alignment | Obscure libs. | Uses supported stack. | External vendor SDK. |

### [X.12.4] Weighted Scoring Table

| Criterion | Weight | [X]-O1 | [X]-O2 | [X]-O3 |
|------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Implementation Complexity | 0.25 | 5 | 3 | 2 |
| Performance / Quality Impact | 0.25 | 3 | 4 | 2 |
| Maintainability | 0.20 | 4 | 4 | 3 |
| Extensibility / Roadmap Fit | 0.20 | 2 | 5 | 3 |
| Ecosystem Alignment | 0.10 | 3 | 5 | 2 |
| **Weighted Total** | **1.0** | **3.4** | **4.3** | **2.6** |

### [X.12.5] Decision Summary

**Selected Option:** [X]-O2 — [Short title]  
**Rationale:** Highest weighted total; aligns with requirements and roadmap.  
**Formal Record:** [[X]-ADR-###_Title.md]([X]-ADR-###_Title.md)

> **Verification:** Decision results and scoring assumptions reviewed by the working group on [date].

2. List required tools, datasets, or configurations.  
3. Specify result collection and reporting methods.

## [X.17] Conformance

An implementation **conforms** to this section when:
1) All **MUST** requirements are satisfied and verified by mapped artifacts;  
2) All **SHOULD** requirements are either satisfied or explicitly waived with justification;  
3) No **MUST NOT** requirement is violated.

## Standards Context

This template aligns with **ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148:2018** (*Systems and Software Requirements Specification*)  
and **IEEE 1016:2017** (*Software Design Description*).

> **Normative content**: measurable, testable requirements (**MUST/SHOULD/MAY**).  
> **Informative content**: context, rationale, and design exploration.  
> **Traceability**: every requirement links to a verification method and code artifact.
