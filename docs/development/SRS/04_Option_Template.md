## 1) Summary

Briefly describe this option’s intent, scope, and distinguishing concept.
Keep it short and outcome-focused.

> **Example:** *Provides a unified architecture for cross-platform runtime while maintaining modular plugin compatibility.*

---

## 2) Problem, Goals, and Non-Goals

**Problem:**
Summarize the issue or need that this option addresses.

**Goals:**

* Satisfies **R-[Section]000**, **R-[Section]001**, **R-[Section]00N**
* Addresses **C1**, **C2**, etc. from SRS [Section.9]

**Non-Goals:**
Explicitly state what this option does *not* cover or prioritize.

---

## 3) Architecture Overview

Describe how this option integrates within the system’s architecture.

* **Core concept:** concise summary of the approach.
* **Primary components / boundaries:** outline interfaces or data paths.
* **Process / data flow summary:** show runtime or control relationships.
* **Integration context:** plugin, service, or subsystem.

```

---

## 4) Interfaces & Contracts

* **Public contracts:** key APIs, schemas, or events.
* **Compatibility policy:** versioning, deprecation, or contract rules.
* **Discovery / registration mechanism:** e.g., manifest, reflection, or registry.

> **Trace:** link to requirement IDs defining these contracts.

---

## 5) Dependencies & Constraints

* **Runtime / libraries:** toolchains, frameworks, or dependencies.
* **OS / hardware:** architectures, devices, or environments.
* **Constraints:** safety, licensing, or compliance limitations.

---

## 6) Security, Privacy, and Compliance

* **Threats & mitigations:** describe known risks and responses.
* **Secrets management:** handling, storage, and rotation policies.
* **Data handling:** encryption, retention, and compliance factors.

---

## 7) Performance & Sizing Targets

* **Latency / throughput:** define measurable objectives.
* **Resource budgets:** CPU, memory, or network limits.
* **Scalability model:** how it scales across workloads.

```

---

## 8) Operability

* **Logging:** format, levels, rotation.
* **Metrics / health:** endpoints, KPIs, monitoring.
* **Configuration:** environment hierarchy, reload rules.
* **Diagnostics:** error capture, crash reporting, trace export.

---

## 9) Packaging & Distribution

* Describe packaging (installer, container, bundle).
* CI/CD flow or artifact outputs.
* Supported runtime modes or environments.

---

## 10) Migration, Rollout, and Backout

* **Migration path:** transition plan from existing approach.
* **Rollout plan:** staged or conditional release.
* **Backout plan:** rollback procedures and triggers.
