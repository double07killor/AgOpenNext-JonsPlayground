# 11 — Operating System Support
*(Status: Drafting)*

**Section ID:** 11 | **Version:** 0.1.0  
**Related Sections:** 12 — Development Language & Runtime, 14 — Build Environment & Tooling  
**Related Decisions:** `11-ADR-001 — Establish Windows & Linux Support Baseline`, `12-ADR-001 — Adopt .NET 10 Runtime`, `13-ADR-001 — Adopt Avalonia 12 for the AgOpenNext Desktop UI Shell`  
**Upstream Dependencies:** 2X — System Architecture, 4X — Interprocess Communications  
**Downstream Impacts:** 5X — Hardware I/O Device Layer, 9X — Frontends & Ops

## 11.1 Purpose & Scope

Define operating system (OS) coverage for AgOpenNext.  
This section establishes expectations for where the application **must** or **should** run at the OS level, and how hardware I/O behaves consistently across supported platforms.

It also outlines the boundaries between the Core (backend/runtime) and UI (frontend) layers with respect to OS dependencies.

> **Purpose:**  
> To ensure consistent deployment, testing, and support targets across desktop, embedded, and mobile environments without constraining future portability.

---

## 11.2 Context

- Depends on the unified runtime defined in §12 (Development Language & Runtime) and the chosen cross-platform UI framework in §13.  
- Interacts with AgIO Hardware Abstraction and related hardware I/O subsystems for serial, UDP, and CAN communication (see §5X).  
- OS-level considerations directly influence build tooling (§14) and deployment packaging (§15).  
- Out of scope: containerization, mobile companion specifics, or packaging formats.


## 11.3 Legacy Comparison

Describe how legacy or prior implementations handled this capability.

| Area / Theme | Legacy Behavior | Identified Limitation | Modernization Opportunity | Reference / Source |
|---------------|-----------------|------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------|
| Deployment | Windows-only desktop installer. | No multi-OS distribution. | Add Linux desktop builds with similar install UX. | [Link] |
| Hardware I/O | Win32 serial/UDP and vendor CAN SDKs. | OS-specific code paths. | OS-agnostic I/O via AgIO abstraction. | [Link] |
| UI | Windows Forms. | Platform-locked UI code. | Cross-platform UI stack (see §12). | [Link] |

> **Informative:** Background only; does not impose requirements.

---

## 11.4 Definitions

| Term | Definition |
|------|-------------|
| **AgIO Hardware Abstraction** | Core hardware I/O subsystem responsible for serial, UDP, and CAN communication. Provides a consistent abstraction layer across supported operating systems. |
| **Platform Tier** | Classification describing the level of official support (e.g., *Primary* for fully tested field targets, *Secondary* for companion or development use). |
| **Cross-Platform Runtime** | The managed runtime and supporting framework stack (e.g., .NET + UI toolkit) enabling builds for multiple desktop or embedded OS targets. |
| **Full Stack Support** | Deployment mode where both Core and UI run on the same device with direct hardware access. |
| **Companion UI Support** | Deployment mode where only the UI runs locally and connects to a remote Core over the network. |

---

> **Requirement Grammar (per [RFC 2119](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2119)):**  
> - **MUST / MUST NOT** — Mandatory; verifiable through test or inspection.  
> - **SHOULD / SHOULD NOT** — Strong recommendation; exceptions must be justified and documented.  
> - **MAY** — Optional; permitted when enabling conditions are clearly defined.  
>
> **Clarity Checklist:**  
> - Express each requirement as a single, testable behavior.  
> - Avoid compound statements.  
> - Use measurable or observable outcomes wherever possible.

- Must avoid OS-specific forks in I/O logic; AgIO is the single abstraction.  
- Must respect platform code-signing/notarization requirements.

### 11.7.1 Non-Functional Requirement Classes

- **Performance:** render/frame targets, I/O latency.  
- **Reliability & Availability:** startup success, error handling for missing drivers.  
- **Security:** signed artifacts, trusted transports.  
- **Portability:** Windows x64; Linux x86-64 and ARM64.  
- **Maintainability:** minimize OS-conditionals outside AgIO.

## 11.9 Design Considerations

| ID | Consideration | Description |
|----|---------------|-------------|
| **C1** | Primary desktop baseline | At least one desktop-class OS serves as the baseline environment for field operators and validation. Specific OS selections will be defined in ADR 11-001. |
| **C2** | Cross-platform parity | Additional OS builds SHOULD provide equivalent functionality using the same codebase and shared runtime. |
| **C3** | Unified I/O | Serial, UDP, and CAN interfaces MUST remain OS-agnostic through the AgIO abstraction layer. |
| **C4** | Native packaging | Prefer platform-native installers or package formats; avoid custom loaders or scripts when a standard mechanism exists. |
| **C5** | Performance guidance | Publish minimum hardware targets and benchmark expectations for each officially supported platform tier. |

### 11.9.1 Assumptions & Preconditions

- **[A1]** The cross-platform UI framework renders consistently across all supported desktop OSes.  
- **[A2]** Required device classes (serial adapters, CAN interfaces, network sockets) are available or documented per OS.  
- **[A3]** Build tooling can produce native installers or packages per supported OS without manual intervention.  
- **[A4]** The AgIO layer abstracts any OS-specific driver or API differences.
