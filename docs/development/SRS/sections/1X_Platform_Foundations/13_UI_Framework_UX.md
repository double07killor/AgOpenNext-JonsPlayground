# 13 — UI Framework & UX
*(Status: Drafting)*

**Section ID:** 13 | **Version:** 0.1.0  
**Related Sections:** 11 — Operating System Support, 12 — Development Language & Runtime, 9X — Frontends & Ops  
**Related Decisions:** `13-ADR-001 — Adopt Avalonia 12 for the AgOpenNext Desktop UI Shell`, `12-ADR-001 — Adopt .NET 10 Runtime`
**Upstream Dependencies:** 2X — System Architecture, 4X — Interprocess Communications  
**Downstream Impacts:** 9X — Frontends & Ops, Training & User Experience

## 13.1 Purpose & Scope

Define the presentation technologies, layout systems, and UX policies for AgOpenNext desktop and companion clients.
Balance legacy WinForms expectations with modernization via Avalonia and remote client strategies; WPF maintenance is explicitly out of scope.

---

## 13.2 Context

- WinForms remains the production UI for operators via AgOpenGPS v6; WPF experiments are retired.
- Remote clients and metadata-driven dashboards require cross-platform components.
- Avalonia 12 pilots aim to share view models across Windows/Linux and mobile shells.
- UI stack must coexist with headless Core deployments connected through gRPC or WebSockets.

### Journeys to keep in mind

- **Operator upgrading in the cab:** Runs daily work on AgOpenGPS v6 WinForms and evaluates AgOpenNext Avalonia builds on spare hardware without risking production rigs.
- **QA verifying run modes:** Uses the Avalonia shell to swap between LocalInProc and CompanionRemote, ensuring the same dashboard cards appear without manual window reshuffling.
- **Dealer supporting a headless rig:** Runs Avalonia on a Windows laptop while connected to a Linux Core over gRPC, confirming metadata-driven dashboards populate automatically.

> **Visual reference:** The annotated layouts in `docs/UI/floating-block-overview.md` and the run-mode walkthrough in `docs/UI/avalonia-run-modes.md` show how windows, panels, and dashboards change between WinForms and Avalonia.

---

## 13.3 Legacy Comparison

| Area / Theme | Legacy Behavior | Identified Limitation | Modernization Opportunity | Reference / Source |
|---------------|-----------------|------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------|
| WinForms UI | Primary operator interface with OpenGL panels. | Windows-only, limited touch support. | Maintain compatibility while introducing cross-platform Avalonia shell. | Production UI |
| Retired WPF Experiments | Prototype panels with limited adoption. | Unmaintained; no release path. | Document lessons learned and move on. | WPF branch archive |
| Configuration UX | Manual wiring of dashboards and inspectors. | Slow to surface new layers/metrics. | Adopt metadata-driven dashboards (O-UI-5). | UX backlog |

---

## 13.4 Definitions

| Term | Definition |
|------|-------------|
| Companion Mode | Remote UI connecting to headless Core via network transport. |
| Metadata-driven UI | Dynamic dashboards derived from schema/metadata rather than hard-coded panels. |
| Run Mode | Operating mode toggles: CompanionRemote, LocalInProc, LocalOutOfProc. |

---

> **Requirement Grammar (RFC-2119):**
> - **MUST / MUST NOT** specify mandatory UI obligations.
> - **SHOULD / SHOULD NOT** highlight strong recommendations.
> - **MAY** identifies optional capabilities or roadmap items.

## 13.5 Requirements

| ID | Priority | Category | Summary | Source / C-IDs | Key Metrics / Verification |
|----|-----------|-----------|----------|-----------------|-----------------------------|
| R-UI-001 | MUST | Legacy Support | Keep WinForms desktop UI shipping with mapping, PGN tools, OpenGL panels. | Legacy operators | Windows regression suite |
| R-UI-002 | SHOULD | AgIO Config | Maintain AgIO Windows Forms dialogs for device setup. | AgIO maintainers | UI automation on dialogs |
| R-UI-003 | SHOULD | Multi-monitor | Preserve window placement helpers for multi-monitor cabs. | Operator feedback | UI layout tests |
| R-UI-004 | SHOULD | Metadata Widgets | Provide metadata-driven widgets to surface new layers without code rewrites. | Metadata dashboards backlog | Prototype dashboards hitting feature checklist |
| R-UI-005 | SHOULD | Remote Clients | Enable frontends that attach to headless Core via gRPC/Web transport. | Remote client plan | End-to-end remote client demo |
| R-UI-006 | COULD | Cross-platform Stacks | Evaluate kiosk-friendly cross-platform stacks (Qt, Avalonia, Web). | Linux Core roadmap | Comparative spike reports |
| R-UI-007 | SHOULD | Accessibility | Support high-DPI scaling, contrast presets, localization hooks. | Accessibility WG | Accessibility test matrix |
| R-UI-008 | MUST | Shared Mobile Shell | Keep Avalonia project free of platform-specific forks for mobile builds. | 13-ADR-001 Avalonia 12 UI | Mobile CI builds |
| R-UI-009 | SHOULD | Run-mode Toggles | Provide configuration surface for run-mode switching. | 13-ADR-001 Avalonia 12 UI | QA scenarios covering run modes |

> **Why it matters:** These requirements let today’s operators trust the WinForms UI, show what Avalonia adds (touch layouts, metadata dashboards), and guarantee remote clients see the same widgets without custom coding.

### 13.5.1 Requirement Sources & Rationale

| Req ID | Source | Rationale |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| R-UI-000 | Production deployments | Preserve current operator workflows during transition. |
| R-UI-004 | Metadata-driven dashboards option (9X) | Accelerate UI iteration without code changes. |
| R-UI-005 | Linux Core roadmap | Ensure headless deployments still deliver UX. |
| R-UI-008 | 13-ADR-001 Avalonia 12 UI | Keep shared codebase across desktop/mobile. |

---

## 13.6 Acceptance Criteria & Verification

- WinForms (v6) regression tests stay green alongside Avalonia smoke tests covering multi-monitor layouts.
- Metadata dashboard prototypes demonstrate dynamic widget loading.
- Remote client demo proves gRPC transport viability for CompanionRemote mode.

### 13.6.1 Requirement-to-Verification Map

## 13.10 Option Overview

Define viable UI framework and UX strategy options for AgOpenNext, balancing modernization with operator familiarity.

| Option ID | Status | Type / Theme | Description | Reference Document |
|-----------|--------|--------------|-------------|--------------------|
| **13-O1** | Proposed | Cross-Platform Desktop | Use **Avalonia 12** as the modern desktop shell for Windows and Linux, sharing view models, layouts, and theming across platforms. | `13-ADR-001 - Adopt Avalonia 12 for the AgOpenNext Desktop UI Shell.md` |
| **13-O2** | Retained | Legacy Compatibility | Maintain **WinForms (v6)** as the stable, production-proven UI during the transition to Avalonia. | `Legacy SourceCode/V6/` |
| **13-O3** | Exploratory | Web / Companion UX | Evaluate **web-based dashboards** (e.g., Blazor Hybrid or WebAssembly) to connect to headless Core instances via gRPC/WebSocket. | `docs/UI/web-ui-concepts.md` *(placeholder)* |

> **Informative:**  
> These options capture the present and near-term UI stack choices.  
> Only Option 13-O1 (Avalonia) is expected to become normative through ADR 13-001;  
> WinForms remains supported for legacy continuity, and Web UX exploration is future scope.

| **Extensibility / Web Readiness** | Foundation for future web or hybrid companion UIs. | 0.15 |
| **Accessibility / Localization** | Compliance with WCAG 2.1 and translation hooks. | 0.10 |
| **Total** |  | **1.00** |

> **Note:**  
> Current pilots favor **13-O1 (Avalonia)** for maintainability and roadmap alignment,  
> but §13 remains decision-agnostic until ADR 13-001 is formally approved.

---

## 13.13 Evaluation & Verification

- Conduct usability studies comparing WinForms vs. Avalonia shells.
- Validate metadata-driven UI flows in staging environment with operator feedback.
- Record latency metrics for remote clients (target ≤ 120 ms input round-trip).

---

## 13.14 Implementation Policy

*(Reserved — implementation decisions are captured in ADRs such as `13-ADR-001`.)*

---

## 13.15 Community Sentiment

- Operators request gradual transition; WinForms must remain stable via the existing v6 distribution while AgOpenNext matures separately.
- Contributors endorse Avalonia due to shared C# skill set and mobile ambitions.
- UX working group emphasizes metadata-driven approach to reduce manual dashboard wiring.
